# Profile Page
## Date: 7/7/25
## Objective:

To design a simple Profile Page using HTML that displays a user's profile image, name, headings, and a short bio, suitable for personal or academic purposes.

## Tasks:

#### 1. Set Up the HTML Structure:

Use ```<!DOCTYPE html>```, ```<html>```, ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags to define the basic structure.

Add an appropriate <title> such as "My Profile".

#### 2. Add Page Headings:

Insert a main heading using ```<h1>``` for the user's name.

Include subheadings such as ```<h2>``` or ```<h3>``` for titles or roles (e.g., "Student", "Web Developer").

#### 3. Insert a Profile Image:

Use the ```<img>``` tag to display the user’s profile picture.

Add alt text and set basic attributes like width and height.

#### 4. Include a Short Bio Section:

Add a paragraph using <p> to provide a short introduction or biography.

The content may include education, interests, or a personal statement.

#### 5. Organize Content Using HTML Elements:

Use ```<section>```, ```<div>```, or ```<article>``` for logical grouping.

Add a horizontal line (```<hr>```) to separate sections.

#### 6. Keep the Design HTML-Only:

Do not use CSS or JavaScript.

Focus on semantic HTML and readability.
